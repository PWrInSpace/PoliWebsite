Despite the fact that the club itself operates at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, thanks to the interdisciplinary nature of its projects, it brings together students from all over Wrocław University of Technology. Our main project is the PoliWRocket project - building experimental sounding rockets. We create our constructions on our own - starting from the design phase, through 3D modelling and workshop work, while developing our knowledge and technical skills.So far, we have managed to construct 8 main rockets and make 16 successful flights. Every year we participate in the Spaceport America Cup student rocketry competition in the United States and the European Rocketry Challenge in Portugal to compete against teams from all over the world.",

      "title": "INTRO",
      "subtitle": "OUR STORY",
      "text": "The PWr in Space Scientific Club was founded in 2017, when a dozen people came together with a shared love of space. The first rocket made by the founding team was the R1 Micro, which was just 750 mm and 0.8 kg. In addition to the technical work done in the association, from the beginning the students were keen to participate in conferences, workshops and training sessions, which gave them the opportunity to meet new companies, organisations and their new technological solutions. Thanks to the commitment of the members of the club, it was possible to attract sponsors and encourage them to cooperate. After just two years of arduous work and acquiring the necessary knowledge, we managed to go to the first Spaceport America Cup 2019 competition in the United States, in which we took 5th place. For such a young team, this was a huge accolade. Thus began the club's adventure of competing  against teams from all over the world."

      "title": "ABOUT US",
      "subtitle": "WHO WE ARE",
      "text": "Currently, several dozen people are active in PWr in Space with two projects: PoliWRocket and PoliFloater. In them, they make use of modern technologies in software, composite materials, 3D printing and material sintering. The research circle has developed innovative solutions over these several years of activity, which are appreciated by judges at international competitions or companies in the space industry. These include a hybrid engine, a system for actively controlling the trajectory of a rocket in flight or the use of a winder to make rotating solids. Although the association itself is based at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, it brings together students from across the Wrocław University of Technology. Our latest and most ambitious project was the construction of the R5 hybrid rocket, capable of reaching an apogee of 3048 metres (10,000 feet) and carrying a payload of at least 4 kilograms. These numbers are not coincidental and refer to the competition in which the R5 rocket competed and was successful, such as 2nd place at the aforementioned SAC 2023 competition. All modules and components of the rocket, including the engine, critical electronics, launch structure or recovery module, were carefully designed and manufactured by us."
