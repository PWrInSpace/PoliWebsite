      "subtitle": "OUR STORY",
      "text": "PWr in Space students scientific association was founded in 2017, when a dozen people came together with a shared love of space. The first rocket made by the founding team was the R1 Micro, which was only 750 mm and 0.8 kg. In addition to the technical work done in the organization, from the beginning the students were eager to participate in conferences, workshops and training sessions, which gave them the opportunity to learn about new companies, organizations and their modern manufacturing solutions. Thanks to the commitment of the members of PWr in Space, it was possible to gain interest of sponsors and encourage them to cooperate. After just two years of painstaking work and acquiring the necessary knowledge, we managed to go to the first Spaceport America Cup competition in the United States, in which we took 5th place. For such a young team, this was a great honor. This is how the organization's adventure with competitions and competition with teams from all over the world began."

      "title": "ABOUT US",
      "subtitle": "WHO WE ARE",
      "text": "Currently, several dozen people are active in PWr in Space, implementing three projects: PoliWRocket, PoliFloater and PoliPlane. They are utilizing modern technologies in software, composite materials, 3D printing and material sintering. The scientific association has developed innovative solutions over these several years of activity, which are appreciated by judges at international competitions or companies in the space industry. These include a hybrid engine, a system for actively controlling the trajectory of a rocket in flight, or the use of a winder to create rotating solids. Although the circle itself is based at the Department of Mechanical Engineering, it brings together students from all over Wroclaw University of Technology. Our latest and most ambitious project was the construction of a hybrid-powered R5 rocket, capable of reaching an apogee of 3048 meters (10000 feet) and lifting a payload of at least 4 kilograms. These numbers are not coincidental, and refer to the competition in which the R5 rocket competed and succeeded, such as 2rd place at the aforementioned SAC 2023 competition. All modules and components of the rocket, including the engine, critical electronics, launch structure or recovery module, were carefully designed and manufactured by us."
